<h2>Object Oriented Programming End Semester Project</h2>
<p>This is a very basic Attendance tracker for multiple sections of a college. The program tracks attendance data for 1 year.</p>
<p>Allows teachers to view and mark the attendance for one or multiple sections.</p>
<p>Allows student to view their overall attendance for the year (can be modified based on the course credits/no of lecture hours/college timetable).</p>
<p>This project implements simple but fundamental concepts of JAVA like:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Conditional Statements</li>
   <li>Inheritance</li>
   <li>Exception Handling</li>
   <li>Method Overriding</li>
   <li>Interfaces</li>
</ul>

   
<p>The program is menu-driven and user friendly, providing updates and confirmations based on the changes the user makes.</p>

<p>NOTE: This project currently limited to the CLI and may be integrated with JavaFX/Swing or HTML/CSS in the future.</p>
