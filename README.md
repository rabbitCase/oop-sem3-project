This project implements simple but fundamental concepts of JAVA like:
1) Conditional Statements
2) Inheritance
3) Error Handling
4) Exception Handling
5) Method Overriding 
6) Interfaces etc
   
The program is menu-driven and user friendly, providing updates and confirmations based on the changes the user makes.
